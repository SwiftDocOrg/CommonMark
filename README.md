# CommonMark

![CI][ci badge]
[![Documentation][documentation badge]][documentation]

A Swift package for working with [CommonMark][commonmark] text.
It's built on top of [libcmark][cmark] 
and fully compliant with the [CommonMark Spec][commonmark].

## Usage

```swift
import CommonMark

let markdown = #"""
# [Universal Declaration of Human Rights][udhr]

## Article 1.

All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. 
They are endowed with reason and conscience 
and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

[udhr]: https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ "View full version"
"""#

let document = try Document(markdown)
```

### Inspecting Document Nodes

```swift
document.children.count // 3

let heading = document.children[0] as! Heading
heading.headerLevel // 1
heading.children.count // 1

let link = heading.children[0] as! Link
link.urlString // "https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/")
link.title // "View full version"

let subheading = document.children[1] as! Heading
subheading.headerLevel // 2
subheading.children.count // 1

let subheadingText = subheading.children[0] as! Text
subheadingText.literal // "Article 1."

let paragraph = document.children[2] as! Paragraph
paragraph.description // "All human beings [ ... ]"
paragraph.range.lowerBound // (line: 5, column: 1)
paragraph.range.upperBound // (line: 7, column: 62)
```

### Rendering to HTML, XML, LaTeX, and Manpage

```swift
let html = document.render(format: .html) // <h1> [ ... ]
let xml = document.render(format: .xml) // <?xml [ ... ]
let latex = document.render(format: .latex) // \section{ [ ... ]
let manpage = document.render(format: .manpage) // .SH [ ... ]

// To get back CommonMark text, 
// you can either render with the `.commonmark` format...
document.render(format: .commonmark) // # [Universal  [ ... ]
// ...or call `description`
// (individual nodes also return their CommonMark representation as their description)
document.description // # [Universal  [ ... ]
```

### Creating Documents From Scratch

#### Using Result Builders

In Swift 5.4 and later,
you can create CommonMark documents using `@resultBuilder` initializers.

```swift
import CommonMark

let document = Document {
    Heading {
        Link(urlString: "https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/",
                title: "View full version")
        {
            "Universal Declaration of Human Rights"
        }
    }

    Section { // sections increase the level of contained headings
        Heading { "Article 1." } // this is a second-level heading
    }

    // block-level strings are parsed as CommonMark literals
    """
    **All** human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
    They are endowed with reason and conscience
    and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
    """
}
```

#### Using the Conventional Approach

The following code produces the same result as the preceding example,
using conventional Swift initializers.

```swift
let link = Link(urlString: "https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/",
                title: "View full version", 
                text: "Universal Declaration of Human Rights")
let heading = Heading(level: 1, children: [link])

let subheading = Heading(level: 2, text: "Article 1.")

let paragraph = Paragraph(children: #"""
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
They are endowed with reason and conscience
and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
"""#.split(separator: "\n")
    .flatMap { [Text(String($0)), SoftLineBreak()] })

Document(children: [heading, subheading, paragraph]).description == document.description // true
```

## CommonMark Spec Compliance

This package passes all of the 649 test cases
in the latest version (0.29) of the [CommonMark Spec][commonmark spec]:

```console
$ swift test
	 Executed 649 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 0.178 (0.201) seconds
```

## Requirements

- Swift 5.1+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the CommonMark package to your target dependencies in `Package.swift`:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "YourProject",
  dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/CommonMark",
        from: "0.5.0"
    ),
  ]
)
```

Then run the `swift build` command to build your project.
